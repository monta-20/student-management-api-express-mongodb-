# Student Management API (Express + MongoDB)

This is a RESTful API built using **Express.js** and **MongoDB** for managing student records. It supports all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and is secured using **JWT** for authentication. **Bcrypt** is used for password hashing to enhance security.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Perform GET, POST, DELETE, and PATCH requests.
- **Secure Access**: JWT-based authentication and authorization.
- **Input Validation**: Input data is validated using Joi to ensure data integrity.
- **Password Hashing**: Secure password storage using Bcrypt.
- **Environment Variables**: Managed through dotenv for configuration.
- **CORS Enabled**: Cross-origin requests are controlled using CORS middleware.
